# Visual Sort Application

A React application that visually demonstrates sorting algorithms, including:

- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Heap Sort**

This project provides an intuitive visual representation of how these algorithms work, facilitating a better understanding of the sorting process.

## Visualization Legend

- **Light Blue**: Initial state of the array.
- **Yellow**: Division or partitioning (used in Merge Sort and Quick Sort).
- **Red**: Comparison between two elements.
- **Green**: Comparison is completed; the elements are either swapped or remain in their positions.
